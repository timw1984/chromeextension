https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-tab-map/eehkgnjcficnmpnocjabenpcigiljeml

This is a google chrome extension I have created using ESRI Leafelet.  

Open a new tab and explore an interactive map of a random sports stadium behind a Google search!
This is a must have for every sports or mapping fan!

V2.0: Added team logos and names

When you open a new Tab, it will randomly show a NFL, MLB or CFB stadium behind a google search bar. You can also pick your favorite stadium and only show it.

In the tab you can do the following:

- Zoom in/out and pan the map
- You can switch between Aerials and a Street Map
- Click on the Stadiums name and see its Wikipedia entry
- Add shortcut buttons to popular websites

In the future I will add more sports arenas (NBA/NHL),shortcut options and mapping functions.
